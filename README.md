# ComfyUI Workflows

A lovingly chaotic, beautifully disorganized, and charmingly mysterious collection of workflows for ComfyUI. Here be dragons (and probably some broken nodes).

## What's Inside?

- Various workflows that somehow work (most of the time)
- Configurations that were created through equal parts inspiration and desperation
- A testament to the "if it works, don't touch it" philosophy

## Usage

1. Clone this repository (if you dare)
2. Import the workflows into ComfyUI
3. Cross your fingers
4. Press play
5. Hope for the best

## Contributing

Found a way to make these workflows less chaotic? Keep it to yourself - we embrace the chaos here! (But if you must, PRs are welcome)

## License

Feel free to use these workflows however you want. If something breaks, you get to keep both pieces! ðŸŽ‰

## Disclaimer

These workflows come with absolutely no guarantee of working as intended, or working at all. Use at your own risk and entertainment!
